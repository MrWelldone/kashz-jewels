## UPDATE (11/01/2021)

I am OSCP Certified :trophy:. More about my experience
at [my reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/oscp/comments/qlay94/passed_oscp_my_thoughts/).

## <mark style="color:blue;">About me</mark>

Hi, I'm Kashz, a gamer and security enthusiast. You can reach me at Discord: **k4shz#1428**

My collection of solved HTB boxes are documented at

* [kashz.gitbook.io/hackthebox-writeups/](https://kashz.gitbook.io/hackthebox-writeups/)

## <mark style="color:blue;">About this book</mark>

This book is an organized collection of notes that I prefer not keep searching on Google every time I come across
something from the past. I started this mainly to have a wholesome documentation for my OSCP exam.

I will outrightly say **all the content available is present on the internet**, I just happen to come across them while
solving boxes and wanted to have it **organized** to come back to at a later date if I need it. That's how this book
started and has grown overtime.

Special mention to [HackTricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz) as some of my pages directly link there for guide which
explains way better.

## <mark style="color:blue;">Sections</mark>

1. **OS Linux |** Linux based enumeration, privilege escalation, tools etc.
2. **OS Windows |** Windows based enumeration, privilege escalation, tools etc.

## :warning: <mark style="color:red;">DISCLAIMER</mark> :warning:

My notes reflect **my understanding** and how I have used the commands/tools. I may be wrong or misunderstood something.

Some of my sections are very detailed, organized and others are chaos. Overtime I'll try to clean my notes. As I come
across something more often, the more clean the notes will be.
