## Post Exam Review

To be honest, this exam is a really close emulation of a real world pentest. OSINT + Active Directory and
post-compromise enumeration, all were perfect and fun to do while in an exam environment.

I'll keep this really short. Considering I passed the OSCP exam like a month before, I did not do the **Linux & Windows
Privilege Escalation courses**; focussed only on **Practical Ethical Hacking (PEH), OSINT and Pentest External
Playbook**; All of which is excellent.

I however did think I need to get faster while using the tools so made a list of few boxes which I did and all taught me
something different and were good practice.
